# Toy Robot (React + Vite)

Simple toy robot simulator UI built with Vite and React.

## Prerequisites
- Install Node.js 18+ (includes npm) from https://nodejs.org

## Quick start
1) Clone or download this repo, then open a terminal in the project folder.  
2) Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3) Run the dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Vite will print a local URL (typically http://localhost:5173). Open it in your browser.

## Build for production
```
npm run build
```
The optimized files will be in `dist/`; serve that folder with any static file server.
